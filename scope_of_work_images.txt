* **Safety:**  Follow manufacturer's instructions for safe installation and connection. Use appropriate PPE.

**4.4. Installation of New Switchgears:**

* **Task Description:** Install three new switchgears (model and amperage to be specified) into the control system. Connect the switchgears according to the manufacturer's specifications and electrical schematics.
* **Safety:**  Follow manufacturer's instructions and all relevant electrical safety codes. Use appropriate PPE.  Ensure proper grounding.

**4.5. System Testing and Commissioning:**

* **Task Description:** Thoroughly test the newly installed control system to ensure all components are functioning correctly.  Document the test results.
* **Safety:** Verify all safety interlocks and emergency stop functions are operational.

**5. Assumptions:**

* Access to the designated area is unrestricted.
* All necessary permits and approvals are obtained prior to commencing work.
* Detailed wiring diagrams and manufacturer's instructions for the Ellen Bradley system, PLC panels, and switchgears will be provided.
* Power will be disconnected during the decommissioning and installation phases.

**6. Exclusions:**

* This Scope of Work does not include any work beyond the specified replacement and installation tasks.
* Any unforeseen issues or modifications requiring additional work will be addressed through a separate change order.
